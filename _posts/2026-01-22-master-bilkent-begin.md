I am delighted to announce that today marks the official start of my graduate studies. I have joined the **Department of Computer Engineering at Bilkent University** as a Master's student.

I am privileged to be conducting my research under the supervision of **[Prof. Ercument Cicek](https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~cicek/)**. Our work will focus on **Genomic Privacy**—addressing the critical security challenges inherent in processing and sharing sensitive biological data.

Transitioning from my undergraduate studies at METU to this new role at Bilkent represents a significant step in my academic career. I look forward to contributing to the lab's research and tackling complex problems at the intersection of bioinformatics and privacy-preserving technologies.
