I am proud to announce that our research paper, **"From Voice to Code: A RAG-Enhanced Pipeline for Robust Multi-Accent Order Processing,"** was successfully presented today at the **6th International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics (NLPCL 2025)**.

This work, which originated from my undergraduate research at **Middle East Technical University (METU)**, was honored with the **Most Effective Research Award** earlier this year.

### Project Overview
The paper introduces a pipeline that combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to handle diverse accents in technical command environments. By providing context to the model before it generates code (JSON), we significantly reduced error rates compared to standard transcription methods.

This project marks a significant milestone in my academic journey as I transition into my Master's studies at Bilkent University.
