I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Computer Engineering at **Bilkent University**, where I also serve as a **Teaching Assistant**. My research sits at the intersection of **Quantum Computing** and **Network Security**, with a particular focus on Quantum Complexity Theory and cryptographic protocols.

My work explores how emerging technologies impact established security paradigms. Specifically, I am interested in:
* **Quantum Algorithms:** Analyzing the complexity of Simon's and Grover's algorithms, and Quantum Fourier Transforms.
* **Computer Security:** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), PKI, and network defense mechanisms.
* **Distributed Systems:** Investigating the convergence of Quantum and Fog computing architectures.

I have actively contributed to the research community as both an author and a reviewer. I recently published a conference paper on the intersection of **Quantum and Fog Computing** and have served as a reviewer for academic conferences.

I am driven by a curiosity to solve complex computational problems and am actively preparing for future doctoral research.
