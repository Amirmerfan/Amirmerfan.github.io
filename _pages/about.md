I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Computer Engineering at **Bilkent University**, working under the supervision of **[Prof. Ercument Cicek](https://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~cicek/)**. My research focuses on **Genomic Privacy**, developing privacy-preserving technologies for the secure analysis of sensitive genomic data. I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for the department.

Prior to joining Bilkent, I completed my undergraduate studies at **Middle East Technical University (METU)**. My final year research focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition architectures.

My undergraduate thesis, titled *"From Voice to Code: A RAG-Enhanced Pipeline for Robust Multi-Accent Order Processing,"* addressed the challenges of multi-accent speech recognition in automated systems. This work was presented at **NLPCL2025**, where it was honored with the **Most Effective Research Award**.

I am passionate about the intersection of privacy, bioinformatics, and AI, and I am actively contributing to the research community as both an author and a reviewer.
