## Course Overview

**CS 102** is the second course in the freshman programming sequence at Bilkent University. While CS 101 introduces algorithmic thinking using Python, CS 102 focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and low-level data structure implementation using **Java**.

The course emphasizes strict typing, memory management, and software engineering principles.

## My Role as Teaching Assistant

As a graduate Teaching Assistant, my responsibilities focus on the practical application of lecture concepts during laboratory sessions.

* **Lab Instruction:** I lead weekly 2 x 4-hour lab sessions where I guide students through hands-on coding tasks, debugging Java applications, and implementing data structures from scratch.
* **Code Review & Grading:** I grade weekly lab assignments and projects, providing detailed feedback on code style, efficiency, and adherence to OOP principles.

## Key Topics

* **Java Fundamentals:** Strong typing, memory references, garbage collection.
* **OOP Principles:** Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces.
* **Data Structures:** Custom implementation of Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees.
* **Algorithm Analysis:** Introduction to Big-O notation and complexity analysis.

## Prerequisites

* **CS 101:** Algorithms and Programming I (Python mastery).
